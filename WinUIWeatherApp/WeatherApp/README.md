WinUI-based Weather lookup app

This App runs on .net version 8 and requires windows. 

Dependencies: I have relied on CoderPro.OpenWeatherMaps.Wrapper NuGet package. 
*GitHubLink: https://github.com/coderpros/CoderPro.OpenWeatherMap*

Once launched you will be presented with a text box and search button. 
You have three options to search with: 
1. City Name - example: Denver
2. Zip Code - It only takes the 5-digit zip code. example: 63130
3. Latitude, Longitude - You can enter a set of lat, lon coordinates seperated by a comma and get a reverse-gps lookup. example: 38.3954,-96.5367
